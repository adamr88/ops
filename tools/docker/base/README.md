## Notice

This image is not tracking kali-rolling but kali-last-snapshot which contains a snapshot of the kali-rolling repository at the time of the last official release (eg. 2019.3, 2019.4, etc.). You don't get any updates when you use that image but you should have a working distribution, albeit not fully up-to-date
